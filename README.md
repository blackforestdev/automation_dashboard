## Features
- **Clock Widget**: Displays current time and date with an analog and digital clock.
- **Environmental Sensors Widget**: Shows real-time data for temperature, humidity, and VPD (Vapor Pressure Deficit).
- **Motor Actions Widget**: Allows scheduling of motor movements for various garden automation tasks.
- **Lighting Controls Widget**: Manages lighting schedules with on/off functionality.
- **CO2 Monitoring Widget**: Displays current CO2 levels and allows setting desired CO2 thresholds.
- **Substrate Monitoring Widget**: Shows moisture content (WFV), oxygen levels, and electrical conductivity (EC) of the growing substrate.
- **Irrigation Control Widget**: Manages water sources, irrigation zones, and watering schedules.
